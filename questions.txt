micro ROV questions:
changes to thru holes? what purposes/locations should they be?
-what replaces CAN on 4 pin? ethernet
-ok to use bottom side? yes
-what's the UART thing doing? where does it connect to the pi? It doesn't
-keep analog ins. No
are all tssop 16 packages the same
-would demux need decoupling cap? placed anyway
still both pwms to 1 motor (current) or (switch) to A channels / B channels
how would the magnet sensor communicate

pwm 3 and 4 are mtr_2a_pwm and 2b
there's a 12V instead of +12V (12 to 5 converter)

must add 5V or 3.3V to ADC

NOTE: no ground stitching yet. Will be done after board is reviewed
